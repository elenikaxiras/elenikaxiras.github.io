   	<p>Welcome to the CSE Capstone Project course at Harvard's Institute for Applied Computational Science. Students in the Capstone course get to apply skills such as <b><span class="red">data management</span></b>, <b><span class="red">machine learning</span></b>, <b><span class="red">statistics</span></b>, and <b><span class="red">visualization</span></b>, to solve real-world problems. In groups of three to four, they identify a complex and open-ended problem, and work with the instructor, mentors, and industry partners to propose a solution in the form of a software package, a set of recommendations in a report, or a research paper. Upon completion of this challenging project, students will be better equipped to conduct research and enter the professional world. </p>
    <p>During this course, students get substantial feedback and guidance from the professor, the teaching fellows, their peers, and the industry partners. This feedback process will begin with the data acquisition and data exploration phase and extends through the design and implementation phase of the project. </p>

						<p>Building on the idea of Kaggle (kaggle.com), a site for data science competitions, the students have made a platform that hosts design competitions. In Nester, as this new platform is called, a company posts a design challenge. Designers submit their proposals to the competition. The design community votes on the best ideas. Experts provide feedback on select designs. The company then chooses the finalists proposals and designers incorporate feedback. Consumers can pledge for their favorite designs in the store. Based on the pledges, the company chooses and produces the best product. Consumers who voted on the winner get the product!</p>

                        <p>Airbnb is a global marketplace of rentals of apartments that reach 190 countries and 34,000 cities. In Airbnb, citizens insert their rental offers and rent their own apartments to other citizens, thereby defining a parallel market to traditional offers based upon hotels. We propose to integrate data from Airbnb with data from other sources, including open data, census information, real estate, information about the district, about the house interiors, social sources such as Instagram and Twitter, etc., so as to develop a new scoring system for Airbnb offers, similar to the hotel star system.

          			<p>How many times have you decided to try a restaurant by browsing pictures of the food or the interior? Images, along with reviews, are the most important sources of information for TripAdvisor’s users. This project is about improving the users’ website experience by building a classifier for restaurant images. To do so, we implemented a convolutional neural network, a machine learning algorithm inspired by biological neural networks, to classify pictures into 5 classes: Food, Drinks, Interior, Exterior, Menu
For this project, four graduate students embarked on a real Data Science Adventure: working with and cleaning large amounts of data, learning from scratch and implementing state of the art techniques, resorting to innovative thinking to solve challenges, building their own super-computer and most importantly delivering a working prototype. It had it all. The students tackled the challenge of classifying user-uploaded restaurant images on TripAdvisor into five different categories: food, drink, inside, outside and menus. To achieve this task, they developed a convolutional neural network model that yielded an average accuracy of 87% over the five categories.

          			<p>Legendary is a leading film production company, with 43 Feature films released, 6 films currently in production and 13 billion box office until 2015. Identifying the correct search terms to find social media posts about an entity or concept is a highly challenging task. For instance, the word Fargo may refer to a place (in North Dakota), a TV show, a movie, or a bank (Wells Fargo). The student team analysed 4 million tweets sampled cross 2015 to produce a text-query generation & optimization system. The search index query, constructed from combinations of text tokens constrained to simple logical operators, will return a highly pure set of text documents (few false positives) relevant to a property, such as a film, and also provide a characterization of the query bias (how many false negatives have we lost and are they systematically different than the true positives we found).</p>

					<h5>Partner: Delaney Granizo-Mackenzie, Quantopian</h5>
					<h5>Students: Jonathan Friedman, Christian Junge, and Haosu Tang

<p>Beta hedging is a method of reducing systemic (market) risk. This is usually accomplished by going short some broad market index fund, such as the S&P 500 tracking index SPY. In this project, the students used stochastic optimization to find a different hedging market to effectively reduce volatility and correlation with the S&P 500. 
Beginning with a given portfolio, as well as a random market, they used simulated annealing to find the market that best reduced correlation of a given portfolio with the S&P 500 over some training period. 
They found that beta hedging reduces overall returns, but prevents sharp drops in value during market crashes.  They were generally able to match the performance of traditional S&P beta hedging, but not outperform it.

          			<p>Potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object's potential to make threatening and close approaches to the Earth. To be considered a PHO, objects generally have an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude (H) of 22.0 or brighter (a rough indicator of large size). In this project students will develop the full pipeline which includes data management, algorithmic development and probabilistic predictions of impact.</p>
